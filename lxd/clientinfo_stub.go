// rather than an error, and the endpoint still answers with whatever the
// lease and label providers found — the same principle as rssUnsupported in
// SPEC 065: a value's absence is a state, not a platform complaint.
//
// Note the Linux implementations return false too when a source is missing on
// that particular host (no /proc/net/arp, no bridge or ubus binary), so a
// client needs exactly one branch for both cases.
